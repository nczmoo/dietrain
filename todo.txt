Question
    How to upgrade train?
        increase attack, defense, health
        repair train
        (speed would be too cumbersome in this format)

DESIGN
    Turn this into a turn-based game where you can do one of each per turn:
        move 
        turn around
        build
        upgrade
        fire
    Add modifiers to differents spaces to attack, defense, range, etc.
